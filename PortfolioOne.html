        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="aboutMe">
        <p>Hello! My name is Hlanganani Hlongwane, and I am a passionate and dedicated software developer with a strong 
            background in building scalable and efficient applications. I thrive on solving complex problems through code
            and am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies. With a focus on both front-end and back-end 
            development, I have worked with languages such as JavaScript,and Java, along with frameworks like React 
            and Node.js. My goal is to write clean, maintainable code that enhances user experience and drives business 
            outcomes. I am particularly interested in both front-end and back-end development, and I enjoy collaborating 
            with cross-functional teams to bring creative ideas to life. Whether it's designing intuitive user interfaces 
            or optimizing backend performance, I am always looking for opportunities to push the boundaries of what technology 
            can achieve. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source 
            projects, or experimenting with new development tools.</p></div>

            <h3>Portfolio</h3>
            <ul>
            <p>A portfolio is a collection of work that showcases an individual's skills, achievements, and experience. 
                It is often used in professional settings to demonstrate expertise and qualifications to potential 
                employers, clients, or collaborators. Portfolios can be physical, such as a folder of printed documents, 
                or digital, displayed on websites or platforms. They typically include examples of past projects, case 
                studies, reports, or creative work, depending on the industry. In the context of careers like design, 
                software development, or writing, a portfolio is essential for proving capabilities and past successes.
                I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to put together my current portfolio, and your role.</p>
